        <h1> CSS Note </h1>
        <p>    What is CSS?
            CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. <br>
            It's a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in markup languages like HTML or XML. <br>
            CSS separates the content of a webpage from its presentation, allowing for greater control and flexibility in styling web pages. <br>
    
        Syntax:
            CSS consists of a set of rules applied to HTML elements. <br>
            Each rule consists of a selector and a declaration block. <br>
            The selector specifies which elements the rule applies to, while the declaration block contains one or more declarations separated by semicolons. <br>
            Each declaration consists of a property and a value, separated by a colon. <br>
    
        Selectors:<br>
            Selectors are patterns used to select the elements you want to style. <br>
            They can be simple, like selecting elements by their tag name (p, h1, etc.), or more complex using classes, IDs, attributes, or combinations of these. <br>
    
        Properties: <br>
            Properties define the style aspects that you want to change, such as color, font, size, margin, padding, etc. <br>
            Each property has a specific set of values that it can take. <br>
    
        Values: <br>
            Values are assigned to properties and define how the selected element should look. <br>
            Values can be specific (e.g., 12px, #FFFFFF, italic) or relative (e.g., 1em, 100%). <br>
    
        Inheritance: <br>
            CSS properties can be inherited from parent elements to their children. <br>
            This means that styles applied to a parent element can affect its children unless overridden. <br>
    
        Cascading: <br>
            CSS follows a cascading order of precedence to determine which styles should be applied when multiple conflicting styles are defined. <br>
            Inline styles (styles defined directly on HTML elements) have the highest precedence, followed by styles defined in style tags or in an external CSS file.<br>
            Specificity and source order are also considered in determining which styles take precedence. <br>
    
        Units: <br>
            CSS supports various units for specifying measurements, such as pixels (px), ems (em), percentages (%), and more. <br>
            Understanding and using appropriate units is essential for creating responsive and scalable designs. <br>
    
        Layout: <br>
            CSS can be used to control the layout of a webpage, including positioning elements, creating columns, implementing grids, and more. <br>
            Flexbox and CSS Grid are powerful layout tools introduced in CSS3, providing advanced control over the arrangement of elements on a page. <br>
    
        Media Queries: <br>
            Media queries allow you to apply different styles based on the characteristics of the device or viewport, such as screen size, orientation, or resolution. <br>
            They are commonly used for creating responsive designs that adapt to different devices and screen sizes. <br>
    
        Vendor Prefixes: <br>
            Vendor prefixes are used to apply experimental or proprietary CSS features, ensuring compatibility with different browsers. <br>
            While vendor prefixes were more common in older versions of CSS, their usage has decreased with the adoption of standardized CSS properties. <br>
    
        Frameworks and Preprocessors: <br> 
            CSS frameworks like Bootstrap, Foundation, and Materialize provide pre-designed CSS components and layouts, making it easier to create consistent and responsive web designs. <br>
            Preprocessors like Sass and Less extend CSS with features like variables, mixins, and nesting, enhancing the maintainability and flexibility of stylesheets.</p>
