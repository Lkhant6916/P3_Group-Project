        <h1>What is a Webpage?</h1>
        <p>
          A webpage is a document written in HTML and can be viewed on any web
          browser. It is contained within the web server, which can be accessed
          by entering the URL for that web page, and once it is loaded, it
          appears on the user's web browser. Each webpage is linked with a
          unique URL; hence two pages cannot have the same URL.
        </p>
        <img
          src="https://static.javatpoint.com/blog/images/what-is-a-webpage.png"
          alt="webpage-example"
        />
        <p>
          A webpage may contain
          <strong>
            <i>text, links for other pages, graphics, videos, etc.</i>
          </strong>
          Moreover, it is mainly used to provide information to the user in
          text, images, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          A webpage is a part of a website; it means a website contains
          different web pages. Such as <b>javaTpoint.com</b> is a website, and
          the page currently you are accessing is the webpage. It can be
          understood as an example of a book. So, a Website is like a complete
          book, and a webpage is like a page of that book.
        </p>
        <h2>Difference between a Webpage and a Website</h2>
        <p>
          Since both Websites and Web pages are related to each other, some
          users may use them interchangeably, but they are much different from
          each other. The basic difference between them is that
          <b>
            webpage is a single web document, whereas a Website is a collection
            of different web pages.
          </b>
          Here are some more differences between both of them:

            </td>
            <td>

              Javatpoint.com, which contains information about different
              technologies.
            </td>
            <td>
              It can contain information for a single entity, such as currently
              viewing a web page containing information about this page only.

            <td>
              Some examples of Webpages are the currently viewing page, contact
              page, registration page, the home page, etc.

        <h2>How does a Web Page Work?</h2>
        <p>
          A simple web page is created using HTML, which is a markup language.
          However, we can also use CSS and JavaScript to add more
          functionalities and make it more attractive.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is created using HTML, hence containing different markup tags that
          specify how the data should be formatted on screen.
        </p>
        <p>
          The webpage is contained within the webserver. To load this webpage, a
          client sends the request to the server, and generally, the browser is
          known as the client, which can request the page on the internet.
        </p>
        <p>
          The web browser requests the page on the internet. Once it is
          responded to by the server, the browser interprets the markup tags and
          displays them on the user's screen in the correct format.
        </p>
        <img
          src="https://static.javatpoint.com/blog/images/what-is-a-webpage2.png"
          alt="webpage image"
        />
        <p>
          The browser sends the request for a page or a file via
          <b> an HTTP request. </b> The HTTP is the
          <b>Hypertext Transfer Protocol</b>, a network protocol that allows
          transferring hypermedia documents over the internet between a browser
          and server.
        </p>
        <p>
          Once the request reaches the server, the HTTP server accepts the
          request, finds the requested page, and sends it back to the browser
          through <b>the HTTP response</b>. If a server is unable to find the
          requested page, it returns a <b>404 response</b>.
